As any engineer or scientist will tell you, understanding “Why” things work is what makes you 
good in your field. It’s what allows you to answer important questions that help you solve 
problems in your job, create elegant solutions or advance your science.

Answering “Why” implies you have acquired a deep understanding of the underlying structure 
of the system you are studying. It means you can analyze and deduct and apply reason.

To put it simply: it means you must clearly know your shit.

However, ask “Why” repeatedly and you’ll soon find yourself in uncharted waters. You’ll be 
battling with the great unsolved philosophical questions of all time — many posed by my own 
ancestors — and will soon find something that makes you think long and hard and still unsure 
about whether your answer is the right one.

It was this kind of thinking, during what you could call the finest of summer evenings during
my holiday this summer, that led me to think that “Why?” — this simple 3 letter + 1 symbol 
question — must therefore be the greatest question of all time.

We should kneel down before it and hail it as the limit of our minds. We should simply give in 
and give up.

Yet, as I found myself indulging in these thoughts, the nice sea breeze, a pretty damn good 
cocktail, and the light fading into the night, I realized this is not so.

Admiring the greatness of “Why”, I found myself asking:

> “Why is why the greatest question of all time?”

And then, almost like someone creeping up behind your back, I heard a voice in my mind saying: 
“Why Not?”

It took me a few seconds to realize what had just happened… I downed the rest of my drink to 
make sure. Wait… did it… what… no way…

Could I really have stumbled upon an even greater question? Could “Why Not” be beating “Why” 
in its own game? Blasphemy!!

And yet, the king was dead. Long live the king!

You see, “Why Not” does not just ask you to follow the same mental exercise we have praised 
that “Why” does — which by itself would make it its equal — “Why Not” steps all over it and 
dances on its ashes.

“Why Not” forces you to answer and disprove each and every other explanation to the “Why” 
question. It forces you to single-handedly beat each and every opponent, one by one and all 
at once, beyond a shadow of a doubt. You must go through each possible “why” that — by the way 
— pre-exists, prove it wrong, and continue on to the next one.

Now, you may think — if you’re still following this far, that is — this is straightforward to 
do, but would just take more time. Say there are 10 possible explanations, I’ll just spend 10 
times the time of each why and I’ve got myself a “Why Not” under my belt. Hey, are you an 
engineer/scientist, by any chance? : )

What you’ve just ignored — and THIS is the big fat cherry on the cake — is the sociological 
phenomenon that “Why Not” forces you to go against the flow.

Go against what you know and take for granted. Go against what is taught in schools, what 
you’ll find in books, what you’ll hear on TV (ok, bad example, you should always go against 
that anyway), what your parents will tell you, what the scientific community accepts, what 
the society believes and even go against how nature seems to work.

On the other hand, if you starting asking “Why Not”s, chances are you will be simply ignored, 
put to the side, not promoted, made fun of, not hired, be ridiculed, not accepted, not have 
many friends and frustrated.

And this, dear reader, is why “why not” is hard — and also great. Because it’s not just a 
brain exercise. It’s because the people who dare to ask “Why Not” know they will be breaking 
society’s (or their profession’s, or their science’s) rules. They know they will be swimming 
upstream and be the black sheep in the herd. It’s because “Why Not” is so demanding that it 
can consume you.

And yet. For me, “Why Not” is hope. Because despite all the above, there are people who do it 
anyway and take humanity one step forward with them. And there are people who are open-minded 
enough to follow them.

Minority? Sure, but how many friends do you need anyway ?
