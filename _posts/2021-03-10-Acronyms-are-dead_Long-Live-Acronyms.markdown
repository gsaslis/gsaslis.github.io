Can you have your cake and eat it too, when using acronyms?

Why, yes, you can!!  : )

## The Problem

Acronyms are a pain (because others might not know them), but also helpful (because they speed up your typing).

Wouldn't it be great if you could somehow type an acronym like "RHOAM" and **everyone** would understand that this was,
in fact, referring to "Red Hat OpenShift API Management" ?

## The Solution


How, you ask?
* Just add the acronym to your favourite clipboard manager's list of pre-configured snippets (or whatever it calls them).
* You type "RHOSAK"
* The world sees Red Hat OpenShift Streams For Apache Kafka
*  ＼（＾ ＾）／

By using Alfred Snippets with a bunch of stored acronyms as keywords, you can get the best of both worlds!

You can find my list of snippets in [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/gsaslis/alfred-macos). 

There are now (at the time of writing) **~150 shortcuts for acronyms** there.
