This post is inspired by [this similar blog post](https://blog.istepaniuk.com/i-will-never-work-for-you/) 
and a discussion in an open space session, in SoCraTes UK 2019 (for which I wrote about
[here](https://gsaslis.github.io/posts/socrates-uk-reflections)). 

Ever since, I had been meaning to create my own version of the list of industry 
sectors, for which I would prefer never to write software for.  

It came up again in a discussion last week, so I thought it's finally time I put this together!

## Industries I Would Never Work For

Here goes:

* Weapons, Military & "Defense"
* Finance / High Frequency Trading
* Advertising
* Investment Banking
* Mining, Gas & Oil
* Most Adult Entertainment
* Casinos & Gambling
* Religious Organizations
* Digital Rights Management

This is not an exclusive list. Rather, a working version I will be updating over 
time, with any industry that **I think** doesn't have a positive impact in our society.

To be clear: I don't mind if you are contributing to one of these sectors, or 
working for one of these industries! I acknowledge that not everyone is privileged 
enough to be in a position to pick where they can work. I acknowledge my own 
privilege in doing so. I also acknowledge that others will have a different 
threshold or point of view about these industries and that is fine. 

More than anything, this is an invitation to get you thinking about YOUR list! 

## Invitation

I repeat Ivan's original invitation: Create your own list ! Is there *any* industry
sector you wouldn't work for ? Or would you always work for the highest bidder?
