          </header>

          <div class="article-content">
            <p>I have seen several slack channels by now where a typical chat log, looks something like this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>xxx  11:01
short break
xxx  12:45
off to pick up the kids from school
xxx  12:54
going out to lunch
xxx  13:45
off for lunch as well 
xxx  14:09
late lunch for me
xxx  14:18
back 
xxx  16:26
back from lunch 
xxx  17:38
taking longish break - will be back online later
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I find this quite frustrating and I find myself always wanting to stop and ask the people there a simple question:</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>But social norms do not always allow this, nor do I always have the time to converse on the topic.</p>

<p>That’s why I’m writing this short post, to sum up my thoughts on the subject and use it as a point of reference.</p>

<p>With some luck, some other poor soul out there - that finds this equally frustrating - will find some ammunition 
here to stop this madness.</p>

<h2 id="if-it-is-a-bad-idea-why-do-people-still-do-it">If it is a Bad Idea, Why Do People Still Do It?</h2>

<p>I’ve heard the following arguments:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Someone might be looking for me</li>
  <li>My boss needs to know when I’m working</li>
  <li>It helps my team to know we’re all working together</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-happens-when-you-send-a-slack-message">What Happens When You Send a Slack Message</h2>

<p>But every time you send a message on a slack channel, other folks on that channel have to read it (or at the very least 
scroll past it).</p>

<p>It sounds obvious, but I think people often forget this.</p>

<p>NOTE: I am excluding #general / #random kind of channels, or community slack groups from this discussion.</p>

<p>It works like this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Most slack channels have a specific topic.</li>
  <li>People join those channels to receive messages related to that specific topic.</li>
  <li>People put a lot of effort in tuning their notifications according to the topic.</li>
  <li>Every time you are sending an off-topic message, you are breaking the contract on which people set those 
notifications settings. You are potentially notifying (i.e. interrupting) everyone, to tell them “you’re going out”</li>
</ul>

<p>This is nothing new, or particular to slack by the way. Mailing lists also have specific topics and client inbox filters
are also a way of tuning notifications, according to the mailing list topic. And this has been working like this for a 
long time (decades).</p>

<h2 id="maybe-people-do-this-because-it-also-happens-in-the-office">Maybe People Do This Because It Also Happens in the Office?</h2>

<p>Not at all.</p>

<p>In an office, when you announce “I’m going out”, only the people who are actually in the room (and are actively listening)
will receive that message. The message doesn’t persist, waiting patiently to be received by everyone when they next 
come into the office.</p>

<p>Also, if you had a secretary who would always keep track of your status and be responsible for answering to whomever asks
on your whereabouts, all you had to do would be to update him as you were stepping out. No need for the announcement.</p>

<h2 id="update-your-secretary-slack-status">Update Your <del>Secretary</del> Slack Status</h2>

<p>Don’t get me wrong! There is a very real need for your team / organization to know if you are available at some given time.
People do need to know if you are available and can be reached for work. (The first argument above <em>is</em> valid.)</p>

<p>But if you are using slack, just like thousands of other teams are doing, you should know that the solution offered by 
Slack itself is the User Profile Status field.</p>

<p>If you take the time to update that (rather than send the message), everyone will know what you want them to.</p>

<p>Slack has even made it easier by adding a shortcut (cmd+shift+Y) on a mac.</p>

<h2 id="slack-doesnt-announce-status-changes">Slack Doesn’t Announce Status Changes</h2>

<p>Interestingly, though Slack does support updating your status, it doesn’t announce status changes on the channels 
you’re on. This is a feature, not a bug.</p>

<h2 id="theres-also-google-calendar">There’s Also Google Calendar</h2>

<p>For scheduled time away from the keyboard - or for blocked time on your calendar for focus work - the google calendar 
slack plugin (if your team is using both of those), also takes care of updating your status, so you don’t have to.</p>

<p>In short: if you always make sure your availability is up-to-date in the one place where it should be (your calendar), 
then you shouldn’t really need to do much else…</p>

<h2 id="is-it-ever-ok-to-do-this">Is it Ever Ok to Do This?</h2>

<p>Yes! It’s perfectly fine if your team has <strong>explicitly</strong> decided they want to have a dedicated 
slack channel for availability updates.</p>

<p>It would then be clear that the sole purpose that people would join that channel would be to receive 
those kinds of availability updates.</p>

<p>It’s also perfectly fine - of course - to send these messages to your direct collaborators, e.g. on some tiny 
channel with 2-3 folks on it.</p>

<p>My problem is when people mix these messages with all sorts of other useful messages, in larger channels, significantly 
changing the signal-to-noise ratio in a particular channel. Because when that happens, you run the risk of losing 
useful messages amongst all that noise.</p>

<h2 id="and-what-if-my-boss-needs-to-know-when-im-working">And What If My Boss Needs to Know When I’m Working?</h2>

<p>I’d really like to ask them… why?  : )</p>

<p>Is knowing when you’re at the keyboard, really the best way they have to track your contributions?</p>

<p>Wouldn’t it be better to focus on outcomes, not outputs?</p>

<h2 id="remote-work-is-asynchronous">Remote Work Is Asynchronous</h2>

<p>This is a big topic - and probably warrants its own blog post - but I’m just leaving a short note 
here: remote work doesn’t scale when work always needs to happen synchronously, so - over time - your team
needs to figure out how to work asynchronously. And when work is asynchronous - status updates like “going afk”
make even less sense.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Some of these thoughts may seem a little controversial. Certainly, not everyone I’ve discussed this with 
in the past has agreed - or found the change easy. I would still invite you to give this a thought - and 
drop me a message on twitter @gsaslis, if you would like to discuss this further.</p>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to read this!</p>
