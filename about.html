  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>
    Yorgos is an OSS enthusiast and software craftsman, with a background in concurrency and distributed systems, in telecoms.
    He cares about improving the problem-solving process – not just solving the problem. He helps teams practice clean code
    and improve their software delivery process. He believes deeply in the power of community, and helps run a number of meetups
    & unconferences on the (paradise) island of Crete. His day job finds him automating stuff, at Red Hat, the world’s
    open source leader.
